## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Resch-Gabriel-Z/Machine-Learning-Discovery-Lot.git
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project. This keeps dependencies required by different projects separate. To create a virtual environment, run:

```bash

python -m venv venv
```
To activate the virtual environment, use:

- On Windows:

```bash

.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS and Linux:

```bash

source venv/bin/activate
```


### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install all the required packages using pip. The requirements.txt file in the repository should list all the necessary packages.

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
